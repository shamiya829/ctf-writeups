### Solution:

As seen above, and hinted by the curly brackets as well as the upper boundary of 26, we can attempt the A1Z26 Letter Number Decipher Method 
using: https://www.dcode.fr/letter-number-cipher

After you insert the numbers to the decrytion tool, you obtain the flag: ```PICOCTF{THENUMBERSMASON}```
